In this tiny repository I gathered some of the solutions I made during reading `Introduction to Algorithms`. Feel free to report issues, the repository is going to be updated in the future. At least I hope so.


Testing
=======
In order to test solutions, simply run the following command:

.. code :: bash
    
    python3 -m unittest discover -v --pattern *.py

CLRS solutions are licensed under the MIT License, what allows you to use it for basically anything absolutely for free. It would be great if somebody will find them useful.
